NOTES:

	- For full details of techniques used visit /references.html
	- Summary of techniques:
		- Javascript:
			- We have chosen the jQuery library as a Javascript framework.
			- Cross Slide jQuery plugin for image transition effect.
			- prettyPhoto jQuery plugin for image overlay effect.
		- CSS
			- Less CSS for speed CSS writing.
			- 960 Grid System for layout grid.
			- Google Web Fonts for improved typography.
		- PHP
			- Minify a php based resource minifier (for css and javascript)
			- PHP Basic Templating system (written by us, however a static version of html documents has been created too, see below)
			The base version uses a php templating system. If apache is not installed we have prepared a final "static version" located at /static/index.html

	- Site validates as HTML5, the only validation errors as XHTML1.1 are HTML5 elements and properties. CSS does not validate due to backwards compatibility for CSS3 declarations.
